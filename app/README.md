# App Folder 
The /app/templates folder contains all the code needed to build and launch the dashboard. All you need to do to launch the dashboard is open and run the app.ipynb file or the app.py file. The app.py file is for easy deployment, while the app.ipynb file is meant to make it easy for you to modify the dashboard and keep track of changes. If you wish to add additional question templates, you can add them to the templates.py file. If you wish to test your new question templates, you can do so in the testing_templates.ipynb file. 

The other main element in this folder is the /app/GPT-2 Model folder, which contains code needed to retrain a GPT-2 model based on sample test questions generated from the dashboard (thank you to [madisonmay](https://github.com/madisonmay), [Margaret Mitchell et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993), and [webproduktion01](https://github.com/webproduktion01) who developed this code). This article (https://medium.com/ai-innovation/beginners-guide-to-retrain-gpt-2-117m-to-generate-custom-text-content-8bb5363d8b7f) describes how to retrain and run this model. If you wish to add additional sample question data into this model, you may do so using the /app/Templates/initialize_mongo.ipynb file. However, the GPT-2 model is still very much in development and we do not recommend using it at this time.
